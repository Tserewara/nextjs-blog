```python

        self.image_path = image_path
    
    def compress(self, compression_ratio):
        # Open the image using Pillow
        with Image.open(self.image_path) as image:
            # Calculate the new dimensions based on the compression ratio
            new_width = int(image.width * compression_ratio)
            new_height = int(image.height * compression_ratio)
            
            # Resize the image using Pillow
            resized_image = image.resize((new_width, new_height))
            
            # Save the compressed image with a new file name
